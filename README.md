# UnitTestToolbox
A toolbox provides critical functions when validating large numbers of scripts.  It provides a control mechanism to run and record which of the scripts and functions execute. We run through all of the scripts, even if they fail, and report back results.

This is used by ISETValidate to test ISETCam, ISETBio, and ISET3d.

See the UnitTestToolbox wiki for more information.
